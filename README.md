# WrapContentableSwipeRefreshLayout
SwipeRefreshLayout with wrap_content available for properties of child View
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hi developers.<br/>
<br/>
As many android developers know,<br/>
android.support.v4.widget.SwipeRefreshLayout does not allow<br/>
the WrapContent attribute on child views.<br/>
<br/>
However, we need to use the property in the SwipeRefreshLayout<br/>
when we implement the UI according to the designers' demand.<br/>
<br/>
This layout was made for such a time.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
This layout uses the code from SwipeRefreshLayout,<br/>
so you can use all the features of SwipeRefreshLayout 100% equally.<br/>
So, usage is no different from SwipeRefreshLayout.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As shown in the picture below, any view such as ScrollView, ListView,<br/>
and RecyclerView works well for child view.<br/>
If there are parts that do not work well, please fix them by using PR.<br/>

ScrollView | ListView | RecylerView

The following figure shows this layout in Prism Live Studio,<br/>
an app I am participating in as a developer.<br/>

It's a great live broadcast delivery tool<br/>
and I hope you will use it a lot.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you,<br/>
